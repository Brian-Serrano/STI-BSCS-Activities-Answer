Mangoes are a perfect size with the perfect texture and perfect color and perfect smell and perfect everything. Why? Because they're mangoes and mangoes deserved to be more loved to have their stunningness shared. What if someone discovered a unicorn? The news would spread. I feel the same about mangoes. More people need to know. I could live happily if all I ate were mangoes for the rest of my life because you know why? The glory of mangoes would probably give me super powers to save the world after eating a lot because they can do anything because they're just that good. Never underestimate the power of a mango because one day it just might save your life because they're that good. Just cut it open and dive in and never return from the blissful Wonderland of which you just dove deep into, of course, until the mango is finished. That's when you go buy 50 more and while you're at the store alert everyone you see of the magic you've just discovered. Then go home and eat 50 more mangoes and go into Mango Wonderland 50 more times. Forget all the other food in the world because they don't matter as much as mangoes because they're not mangoes.

The yellow really sweet gorgeous soft delicious goodness. In paticular Pakistani mangoes. But all mangoes are amazing as long as they are sweet. Some taste so good like honey and no sourness. I can't wait till the summer to get mangoes now! Also try mango lassi, its an Indian drink its like milkshake but its made with yoghurt and mangoes. Anyway its gorgeous.

The antioxidants help prevent cancer (colon, breast, leukemia, and prostate), lower cholesterol, clear clogged pores and eliminate pimples, improve vision and protect against dryness, help fight diabetes, and improve digestion as well as the immune system. And, if that wasn't enough, it also improves sex. Mangoes alone, though, are orgasmic to eat.</td>
